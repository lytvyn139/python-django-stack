# Assignment: Filter by Type
# Write a program that, given some value, tests that value for its type. Here's what you should do for each type:
# Integer
# If the integer is greater than or equal to 100, print "That's a big number!" If the integer is less than 100, print "That's a small number"
# String
# If the string is greater than or equal to 50 characters print "Long sentence." If the string is shorter than 50 characters print "Short sentence."
# List
# If the length of the list is greater than or equal to 10 print "Big list!" If the list has fewer than 10 values print "Short list."

def filter_by_type(x):
    if isinstance(x, int):
        if x >= 100:
            print ("That's a big number!")
        elif x < 100:
            print ("That's a small number")
    elif isinstance(x, str):
        if len(x) >= 50:
            print ("Long sentence")
        elif len(x) < 50:
            print ("Short sentence")
    elif isinstance(x, list):
        if len(x) >= 10:
            print ("Big list!")
        elif len(x) < 10:
            print ("Short list")
    else:
        print ("Type cannot be determined. Please try again.")
